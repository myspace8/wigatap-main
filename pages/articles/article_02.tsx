                    <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Integrity and transparency</h3>
                    <p>
                        Integrity means that the foundation is honest and ethical in all its dealings, while transparency means that the it is open and accountable to its stakeholders.

                    <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Empathy</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is another important pillar of the foundation. Empathy means being able to understand and share the feelings of others, especially those who are in need. This quality is essential for anyone working in the charity sector, as it allows them to connect with beneficiaries and understand their needs. The very burning desire to have pity on our fellow men in need is what makes our organization a humanitarian one which has all of its activities channeled into welfare of the unfortunate and less privileged our society.

                    <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Commitment</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a crucial value for the foundation, as it shows that the organization is dedicated to its mission and goals. Commitment means that the foundation is willing to work hard and make sacrifices to achieve its objectives. This quality is essential in the charity sector, where the challenges can be significant, and progress may be slow. By staying committed to its mission, the foundation can inspire others to support its work and make a real difference in the lives of its beneficiaries.

                    <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Equity</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is another key pillar of the foundation. Equity means that the organization is committed to fairness and justice, especially for those who are marginalized or disadvantaged. By promoting equity, the foundation can help to address systemic issues and create more inclusive and just societies. This is making sure that we do not dispense our duties on tribal, religion, gender or political basis
